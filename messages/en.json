    "subtitle": "ABOUT ME",
    "title": "PAVEL JAROŠ",
    "intro": "My name is Pavel Jaroš and I am a real estate agent who constantly strives for professional growth and improvement in the field.",
    "origin": "I come from Cheb and have been in real estate for four years as an investor (purchase - reconstruction - sale). I deal with the very popular so-called property flipping.",
    "motivation": "Since I would like to improve in this field, I decided to pursue the path of a real estate agent. I enjoy this work mainly because of its diversity. I deal not only with business, but also with legal issues and construction itself. Every day is different, which fulfills me.",
    "passion": "I enjoy finding suitable solutions, communicating, connecting suppliers, investors and everything else related to real estate. I like meeting new people and solving cases that others don't know how to handle. Client satisfaction is the highest reward for me.",
    "values": "I am characterized by empathy and fully understand that each client requires an individual and flexible approach. I value good reputation and name.",
    "hobby": "In my free time, I enjoy sports, I can no longer imagine a well-spent day without visiting the gym. As a proper enthusiast, I also love adrenaline - parachute jumps and any adrenaline attractions, I go all in. Life must be lived.",
    "location": {
      "title": "LOCATION",
      "text": "I operate mainly in Prague, in the Central Bohemian and West Bohemian regions, but I am open to cooperation throughout the Czech Republic."
    },
    "experience": {
      "title": "HOW LONG?",
      "text1": "As a real estate investor, I have four years of successful projects behind me, including several successful property flips.",
      "text2": "Until recently, I arranged complete apartment renovations in their original state myself, now I have a small construction company and it is therefore no problem for me to help a client with anything and modify the property so that the result is easy sale and higher profit."
    },
    "commission": {
      "title": "COMMISSION",
      "text": "When selling a property, the fee known as commission is paid by the seller. Ultimately, this is logical because the seller is the one who chooses the agent and whose interests the agent defends. The commission amount is not fixed and may vary depending on a number of factors, such as sales strategy, marketing budget, location and property price. However, the commission usually ranges between 3 - 5% of the purchase price of the property."
